# Tarot
 
A React/Express app I made mostly to get back into practice with webdev. It's hosted at [pentacles.fly.dev](https://pentacles.fly.dev), or [pentacles.page](https://pentacles.page) (if you're reading this in a future where I didn't renew the domain - the fly.dev link should be more stable)


## Sources
Card description text is taken from [The Pictoral Key to the Tarot by Arthur Edward Waite.](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Pictorial_Key_to_the_Tarot) Card art is by Pamela Coleman Smith, via [this archive.org scan.](https://archive.org/details/rider-waite-tarot/) Both are public domain. 
If you want to use my edited/cleaned card text for your own project, it's at `/server/src/cards.json`

The main text font is [Wollstonecraft Romance.](https://fontesk.com/wollstonecraft-romance-font/) 
The header font is [Vulnus.](https://fontesk.com/vulnus-font/)
